TODO

IMPLEMENT GAME STATES

**move functionality from Game to GS_Game

**removing "intelligence" from enemy spawner, make it only create enemies when asked, move spawning logic to the game state itself

**gradually increase difficulty by increasing spawn frequency

**add and draw world boundaries

**create main menu screen

**create game over screen

detect enemy collisions with player, trigger game over screen

create "score" overlay

create pause feature


---- MILESTONE 1 : VERY SIMPLE, BUT FEATURE COMPLETE GAME! ----

	enum of entity types
	factory pattern spawn function

add world object to keep track of level size and boundary thickness
